This extension is intended to provide a means for PHP 8 developers to interface with the SAP NetWeaver SDK.

If you find this project useful consider giving me a cup of coffee using the "Donate" button above.

## Supported versions

The extension is tested with PHP 8.1+ using SAP NW RFC SDK version 7.50.

The extension should still build for PHP 7.3 and 7.4, but this is no longer supported and might break
in the future.

The repository is called `php7-sapnwrfc` for historical reasons only.

### Older versions

The `1.x` branch supports PHP 7.2+ with SAP NW RFC SDK version 7.20 supported up to release 1.3.

**This version is not maintained any more.**
