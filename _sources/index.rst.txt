php7-sapnwrfc - RFC connector for PHP 7/8
=========================================

The `php7-sapnwrfc extension <https://github.com/gkralik/php7-sapnwrfc>`_ 
provides an interface to use the *SAP NetWeaver RFC library* to call
ABAP function modules via the SAP Remote Function Call (RFC) protocol.

To start using ``php7-sapnwrfc``, follow the :ref:`quick-start`.

.. admonition:: Supported versions
   :class: important

   The extension is tested with PHP 7.3, 7.4 and 8.0 using SAP NW RFC SDK version 7.50.

   Support for PHP 8 is experimental and available in the `main` branch of the repository.

.. note::

   This documentation is updated continually and thus always reflects 
   the latest development version of the extension.

If you find this project useful, consider buying me a cup of coffee.
